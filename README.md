# Recipe_1
This is the first React.js project (for a while at least). The reason for creating this series of projects is to learn whilst making an application.
Using source control will allow the projects to be stored in an easier format than on a hard drive, and mean that I can review the design at the end and try and improve.

##Recipe App
This is designed to be a simple React.js app to understand the basic elements of creating controlled components, sending data from the top component down the tree, and creating a simple website.

Further enhancements:
- potentially include getting user data (form input elements)
- retrieve data from DB or API
- including more media types for useful help
- search functionality

##Aims
The aim of this simple project is to take data (starting off as static data probably hard coded in solution) and to display this as a series of entries. Creating small components for each section, and pasing data as properties.
